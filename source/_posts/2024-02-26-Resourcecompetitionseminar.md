This seminar is organised by Christopher Klausmeier as the form of an online seminar on resource competition theory and related ecological theories from January 8th to April 15th 2024. The format is a mix of lectures and discussion of classic and recent papers. Some previous exposure to ecological theories and an intro grad level (e.g. population growth models & competition theory) is desired.

This blog is developed and maintained by Liang Xu, severing as an online lecture and providing an alternative to the programming illustration by Mathematica for those who cannot access Mathematica. The blog is developed using Quarto and hosted on GitHub. The interactive visulation of the model is implemented using R Shiny.
