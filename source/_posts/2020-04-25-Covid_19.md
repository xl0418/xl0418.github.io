The outbreak of the COVID-19 virus has given me a heavy punch. I have been isolated at home for almost two months with one trip to the nearest trash bin every week. What is even worse is that I cannot get any reply from job hunting. Being so stressed, I decided to develop a Shiny app to track the COVID-19 spread. Hope this may give me a sign of recovery of the world by examining daily data. More information can be found [**here**](https://liangxu-groningen.shinyapps.io/corona_shiny/). A differential equation model is still under construction. Coming soon. Enjoy!
