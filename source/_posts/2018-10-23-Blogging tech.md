I am using [hexo](https://hexo.io/zh-cn/index.html) for blogging. The blog website is built on my personal [Github Page](https://xl0418.github.io/). The theme of the blog is [next](https://theme-next.iissnan.com/) which is a powerful tool to customize the blog. Here I would like to share/archive some useful tech for future use.

## Optimizing the theme
Two posts are recommended here on [zhihu](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/30836436) and [CSDN](https://blog.csdn.net/qq_33699981/article/details/72716951). They almost contain all the custom adjustments for the theme. Of course, the official website [next](https://theme-next.iissnan.com/) is a good choice as well. 
Advance tech to make your blog prettier is on this [website](https://reuixiy.github.io/technology/computer/computer-aided-art/2017/06/09/hexo-next-optimization.html). Huge amount of tips and tricks are shown. 

## Materials
To look for some materials like pictures, icons, you can find a lot form [easyicon](https://www.easyicon.net/) and [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) **for free**.
