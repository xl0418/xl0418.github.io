I am Liang Xu, a PhD student in theoretical biology in University of Groningen. I am focusing on modeling species interactions in macro eco-evolutionary science. I am interested in mathematical models as well as deep learning. You can find my CV [**HERE**](./Liang_CV.pdf). For the Chinese version, please see [**HERE**](./CV_Liang_Chinese.pdf)

## Research Interest
 A major challenge in ecology is the need for a better theoretical framework for understanding how species assemblages (ecological communities) arise, why some are species-rich and others species-poor, and why some species are present or dominant whereas others are not. I am interested in how to construct theoretical models to mimic the evolutionary processes and invent efficient tools with explanatory power to the evolutionary issues. This field involves mathematical modeling, Eco-evolutionary science,
