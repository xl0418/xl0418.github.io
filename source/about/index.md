I am Liang Xu, currently a Postdoctoral Researcher collaborating with Prof. Emily Zakem at Carnegie Science. My expertise spans theoretical modeling, bioinformatics, and machine learning, with a keen interest in exploring diverse topics such as species interactions on macro eco-evolutionary scales, species coexistence theory, oceanic modeling, and trait-based modeling. I am particularly intrigued by the application of machine learning techniques in ecology and evolution. For further details, please refer to my CV [**HERE**](./Liang_CV.pdf), with a Chinese version available [**HERE**](./CV_Liang_Chinese.pdf).
