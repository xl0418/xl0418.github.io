I am Liang Xu, a PhD student in theoretical biology in University of Groningen. I am focusing on modeling species interactions in macro eco-evolutionary science. I am interested in mathematical models as well as deep learning. You can find my CV [**HERE**](./Liang_CV.pdf).

## Research Interest
 A major challenge in ecology is the need for a better theoretical framework for understanding how species assemblages (ecological communities) arise, why some are species-rich and others species-poor, and why some species are present or dominant whereas others are not. I am interested in how to construct theoretical models to mimic the evolutionary processes and invent efficient tools with explanatory power to the evolutionary issues. This field involves mathematical modeling, Eco-evolutionary science,

## PhD Projects 
* **Inferring local diversity-dependence**. 
It is still hotly debated that whether there exists ecological limit to diversity. A diversity-dependent diversification model has been developed to infer diversity-dependent signal. However, the model ignores local information. In this project, we aim to model the evolutionary processes incorporating the local details and check that if we can still detect the local diversity-dependence. 
* **Inferring the effect of species interactions on trait evolution**. 
  Ecology and evolution jointly help to form the pattern of traits of species. We construct an eco-evolutionary framework combing both ecological interaction and evolutionary history to describe how traits of species evolve under environmental stabilizing selection and species interactions. 
* **A spatial phylogenetic Jancen-Connell extension to the neutral theory of species diversity**.
  The neutral theory of species diversity opens a new window to explain species assembly. However, the neutral assumption that all changes in distribution and abundance occur because of purely random variation in births, deaths, migration and speciation violates the recognition of the importance in species differences. Here, we focus on tree species and develop a spatial phylogenetic Jansen-Connell extension to the neutral theory. We aim to explore to what extent the additional mechanism indeed affects species assembly.
