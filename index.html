        <p>Oceanic models often comprise two components. The biological part is to describe ecological interaction in food webs locally, often within a single water pacel. The other part makes use of physical modeling of fluid dynamics, simulating how the focal biotic and abiotic organisms move with water by diffusion and sinking.</p>
<p>My project at Dept of Global Ecology of Carnegie Institute for Science at Stanford University is to use this type of oceanic models to look at the vertical profile of bacteria diversity formed by the ecological interaction and the vertical water transferring. </p>
<p>One techniqe used in this research is to simulate the water advection by numerically integrating the fluid dynamics. Thus, the accuracy of the numerical integration is important to correctly capture the patterns of the focal tracers.</p>
<p>Here in this post, I implemented several schemes to acheive the numerical integration. The code is adapted from the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://learning-modules.mit.edu/materials/index.html?uuid=/course/16/fa16/16.920#materials"><strong>numerical methods for partial differential equations course</strong></a> from MIT. </p>

        <p>It’s been a while that I haven’t updated my work and life. On 5th of June, I finally defended my thesis and obtained PhD degree. My thesis can be found <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.rug.nl/about-ug/latest-news/events/promoties/promoties-2020?hfId=119206">HERE</a>. Thank my supervisor Prof. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.rug.nl/staff/r.s.etienne/">Rampal S Etienne</a> and co-supervisor Dr. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.rug.nl/staff/g.s.van.doorn/">Sander van Doorn</a> for their guidance in the last 5 years. Thank my  colleagues for their help on my work, thesis and the defense and the time we share together. Obtaining the degree was not the end of my acdemic life but a milestone and a new start for the next stage. </p>
<p>Since March 2020 and even earlier, I have been looking for jobs, preferably postdoc positions. However, I don’t know whether it is due to the pandemic or not, instead of offers I got many rejections. It was a tough time period for me. Without boarding on a contract, I have no income but have a family to raise.  Luckly, my wife found a job, which seems to some extent to solve our finacial crisis. This allows me to focus on searching for opportunities. Eventually, I found some positions that have a good match for my background. I contacted the group leaders and job posters and tried to highlight myself to gain an interview chance. I got some nice replies but finally they rejected me. The worse part of these rejections is that I don’t even know why I got rejected and where I could improve myself. I started to have doubt on myself. Fortunately, I had one last chance in my first batch of applications.</p>
<p>I encountered one job poster on LinkedIn in July when I was roaming on LinkedIn. Prof. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.plants.ox.ac.uk/people/lindsay-turnbull">Lindsay Turnbull</a>‘s group at University of Oxford is looking for a postdoc to do simulation modeling on community plant assembly. This is exactly compatible with what I am doing on my third project, the best fit one of all the jobs I have ever applied. So, I saw a fair chance in the research. Immediately, I made the application and sent an email to Prof. Lindsay Turnbull. Very soon, I got reply from Lindsay and we had several back and forth communications. One month later, I got an interview invitation and we had a nice chat on my work and the plan of the work of this position. After one week, a formal offer is sent to me. </p>
<p>Year 2020 is awful. However, we should never lose hope. By this post of an update of my recent situation and experience, I would like to encourage people who have currently been in trouble. Trace the rainbow in the rain. </p>

        <p>The outbreak of the COVID-19 virus has given me a heavy punch. I have been isolated at home for almost two months with one trip to the nearest trash bin every week. What is even worse is that I cannot get any reply from job hunting. Being so stressed, I decided to develop a Shiny app to track the COVID-19 spread. Hope this may give me a sign of recovery of the world by examining daily data.

        <p>The outbreak of the COVID-19 virus has given the world a heavy punch in 2020. The growth infection over 30 countries in the world has seen the overwhelming power of the exponential spread of COVID-19 at the early stage. The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) pulled together a coalition research groups and companies (including Kaggle) to prepare the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge">COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19)</a> to attempt to address <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/tasks">key open scientific questions on COVID-19</a>. Those questions are drawn from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/event/03-11-2020/standing-committee-on-emerging-infectious-diseases-and-21st-century-health-threats-virtual-meeting-1">National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine’s (NASEM)</a> and the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.who.int/blueprint/priority-diseases/key-action/Global_Research_Forum_FINAL_VERSION_for_web_14_feb_2020.pdf?ua=1">World Health Organization (WHO)</a>. Flooded by the daily news of how serious the pandemic becomes, I am wondering whether and to what extent the government can stop the pandemic. Specifically, if the government takes a fast response to restrict social activities, will the pandemic be stopped at an early stage? Thus, I took part in one of the competition and built an individual-based virus spread model in which I considered how the speed of the government reaction affects pandemic development. It is an one-week competition that finished in this morning. I create this post by attaching my work <a href="https://xl0418.github.io/Kaggle_corona/"><strong>here</strong></a>. Enjoy!</p>

    <div class="entry">
      
        <p>Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is a kind of likelihood-free method that utilizes computational power to generate a huge amount of simulations with randomly chosen parameters to hit the target - the observations. The generating parameters that produce the results that are most analogous to the observations are recognized as the best inference of the truth. This is analogous to the idea of neural networks of machine learning. The difference is that ABC requests process-based modeling, which bases on knowledge of the underlying mechanism behind the data. In contrast, neural networks neglect such process-based modeling but only needs to construct a neural net structure to train for fitting data. Thus, the advantage of neural networks is that it provides a general inference approach without need of knowing the mechanisms. Nevertheless, the disadvantage is also on it. The interpretation of the processes behind the data is lacking.  This is why it is widely used in pattern recognition but in biological processes interpretation. Both methods have limited structure types although the combination of them can be infinite. Therefore, coding a general framework to fit any type of models is feasible. While Tensorflow of Google and Pytoch of Facebook stand out in machine learning as the examples of such general frameworks, not many groups are focusing on ABC development. Only a recent <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.04694.pdf">package</a> by Dutta et al. in Python is released setting a good example. Here I would like to share a simple version with an application to the recent coronavirus outbreak in the Netherlands. Just for fun and keeping my coding skills warm in the period of quarantine regulation. </p>

        <p>Thesis submitted! Finally, I could have a bit of time to update this blog before getting feedback from reviewers of two submitted papers. So, I will dig several pits as what I did before and see if in the future I could fill them : - ) The first pit stems from my thinking of that how we, biological theoritians, are able to sell  our work to empiricists. Our work and interest are to stablish complex mathematical models to mimic biological processes to reveal the underlying mechanisms, which form the observed phenomenon. We could code the processes, do statistic analysis to select the most prominent mechanism, infer the likely generating parameters. However, empiricists may have problems even setting up an environment for a programming language in which we used to deploy our models as their focuses are on field or lab experiments which I have not a clue of what they are (exaggerated).  Therefore, to bridge the worlds of empiricists and theoritians, a concrete tool is imperative. GUI (Graphical User Interface) of an abstract model is the right way. (This is the way!  – Mandalorian).  In this blog, I introduce one GUI example of my model and show how it works within a few clicks. </p>
