    <content type="text"><![CDATA[PrefaceWriting a periodic progress report is a good way to record the process that you gain knowledge. Reviewing my progress reports in the last 3 years, it recovers my memory about the knowledge and technologies that I almost forgot as I rarely use them. From this post on, I would like to give them a review and share on the blog. Hope it can help people who are interest in and one can help me if I am wrong at somewhere. DerivationHere I briefly present the derivation for the Fokker-Planck equation from a stochastic differential equation. Given the stochastic process $$dx=a(x,t)dt+b(x,t)dW_{t}$$ where \(W_{t}\) is a Wiener process. By Ito lemma, for any twice-differentiable scalar function \(f(x)\) we have $$df(x)=\left(a(x,t)f’(x)+\frac{1}{2}b^{2}(x,t)f’’(x)\right)dt+b(x,t)f’(x)dW_{t}$$ The expectation of \(f(x,t)\) yields $$E(f(x))=\int f(x)p(x,t)dx$$ and take the derivative $$\frac{dE(f(x))}{dt}=\frac{d\int f(x)p(x,t)dx}{dt}=\int f(x)\frac{\partial p(x,t)}{\partial t}dx \tag{1}$$ Also, we could plug Eq.[1] in the expectation of \(f(x)\) and take the derivative yields $$\frac{dE(f(x))}{dt}=\frac{E(df(x))}{dt}=E\left(a(x,t)f’(x)+\frac{1}{2}b^{2}(x,t)f’’(x)\right) \tag{2}$$ From that Eq.[1] and Eq.[2] are identical, we have $$\begin{align}\int f(x)\frac{\partial p(x,t)}{\partial t}dx &amp;=\int\left(a(x,t)f’(x)+\frac{1}{2}b^{2}(x,t)f’’(x)\right)p(x,t)dx \\ &amp; =\int a(x,t)f’(x)p(x,t)dx+\frac{1}{2}\int b^{2}(x,t)f’’(x)p(x,t)dx \\ &amp; =-\int f(x)\frac{\partial a(x,t)p(x,t)}{\partial x}dx+\frac{1}{2}\int f(x)\frac{\partial^{2}b^{2}(x,t)p(x,t)}{\partial x^{2}}dx \\ &amp; =\int f(x)\left(-\frac{\partial a(x,t)p(x,t)}{\partial x}+\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial^{2}b^{2}(x,t)p(x,t)}{\partial x^{2}}\right)dx\end{align}$$ As \(f(x)\) is arbitrary, we obtain the Fokker-Planck equation in one dimension $$\frac{\partial p(x,t)}{\partial t}=-\frac{\partial a(x,t)p(x,t)}{\partial x}+\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial^{2}b^{2}(x,t)p(x,t)}{\partial x^{2}}$$]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[I guess this function is specially useful to our group in which we play with L table. L table is an alternative way to a phylo class for phylogenetic information storage. The function L2phylo has been implemented in the DDD package that converts an L table to a phylo class. This function phylo2L does the conversion the other way around. Thus, if you want to apply your model to an empirical data. This may be useful to you. phylo2L function can be found here if you want to improve the function. I have verified it by examining if L=phylo2L(L2phylo(L)) Notice that phylo2L doesn’t have the argument dropextinct as what L2phylo has. Because to my perspective L table should be consistent with the given phylo class. But if you have a full tree on hand and want to prune it, you can do it like this prune_phylo = L2phylo(phylo2L(full tree), dropextinct = TRUE) prune_L = phylo2L(prune_phylo) Or you can use pruneL function that I have developed to prune an L table. More details on pruneL function can be found in this post.]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[PhD Project 1-Detecting local diversity-dependence in diversification]]></title>
    <url>%2F2018%2F10%2F22%2F2018-10-22-IntrotoPro1%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Welcome to Liang&apos;s blog! This is my first PhD project since 2015 joining Etienne&apos;s lab. You will find a brief introduction to this project. The code for the model can be found on my GitHub. PrefaceThis my first formal research project starting from December of 2015 to February 2018 when the paper gets published. It seems to take quite a long time. Because I spent some time to switch from mathematics to evolutionary science and writing paper costs time as well. Anyway, to commemorate the first paper. AbstractWhether there are ecological limits to species diversification is a hotly debated topic. Molecular phylogenies show slowdowns in lineage accumulation, suggesting that speciation rates decline with increasing diversity. A maximum likelihood method to detect diversity-dependent diversification from phylogenetic branching times exists, but it assumes that diversity-dependence is a global phenomenon and therefore ignores that the underlying species interactions are mostly local, and not all species in the phylogeny co-occur locally. Here, we explore whether this maximum likelihood method based on the non-spatial diversity-dependence model can detect local diversity-dependence, by applying it to phylogenies, simulated with a spatial stochastic model of local-diversity-dependent speciation, extinction and dispersal between two local communities. We find that type I errors (falsely detecting diversity-dependence) are low, and the power to detect diversity-dependence is high when dispersal rates are not too low. Interestingly, when dispersal is high the power to detect diversity-dependence is even higher than in the non-spatial model. Moreover, estimates of intrinsic speciation rate, extinction rate and ecological limit strongly depend on dispersal rate. We conclude that the non-spatial diversity-dependent approach can be used to detect diversity-dependence in clades of species that live in not too disconnected areas, but parameter estimates must be interpreted cautiously. ModelWe have developed a spatial diversity-dependent diversification model to explore if the global version of the diversity-dependence approach could detect the diversity-dependent signal on the spatial scenario. Generating treesThe idea is simple. For simplicity, we build a two-location model and let species evolve (speciate: give birth to a new species/ extinction: one species goes extinct) in the regime. A pack of generated trees under different speciation rates and extinction rates and dispersal rates is like this (Scenario 2, see details in our paper): Applying the bootstrapping analysisWe exploit the bootstrapping analysis to examine the power of the global approah to detect the signal of diversity-dependence on the spatial structered trees. The following tables show the power of the global tool for signal detection under different parameter combinations and scenarios. Parameter inferenceAs due to the complexity of the model, an analytical likelihood function is not possible to achieve. Therefore, we test if the global likelihood approach can recover the parameters on the spatial model or show some patterns. ConclusionFrom the results above, the conclusion is clear.
