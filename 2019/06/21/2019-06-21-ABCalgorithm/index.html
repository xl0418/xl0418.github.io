<h1 id="The-standard-Approximate-Bayesian-Computation"><a href="#The-standard-Approximate-Bayesian-Computation" class="headerlink" title="The standard Approximate Bayesian Computation"></a>The standard Approximate Bayesian Computation</h1><p>With the development of computer science, people start to be able to solve more problems that are high computationally demanding. In 2013, Toni <em>et al</em>. overviewed the standard ABC algorithm and developed a sequential Monte Carlo variant to accelerate the convergence of parameters. This series of ABC-like methods is usually called “likelihood-free” method, or more precisely “analytic likelihood-free method”. The basic idea is that it exploits the computational power of computer to generate large amount of data under the focal model and pick up the parameters that produce the data that is most analogous to the reality. Thus, people claim that the obtained parameters are the most likely parameters to reassemble the truth. </p>
<p>In my project of studying trait-population model, I modified this method a bit and successfully recovered the model parameters from simulation experiments. Later on, I applied our model to baleen whales and found the baleen whales are undergoing a weak environmental adaptation and a relatively strong competition (paper submitted soon).</p>
<p>Here, I would like to show you an animation of how ABC algorithm works.  </p>

<p>In the video, three Monte Carlo chains are deployed. They are independent of each other, exploring the parameter space from different initial conditions. Normally, it is hard to judge when the chain converges. So, you need to run a long time to check. One alternative way is to calculate the autocorrelation of the chain. You can google that if you want to know more details. </p>
<h1 id="ABC-SMC-for-parameter-estimation-and-model-selection"><a href="#ABC-SMC-for-parameter-estimation-and-model-selection" class="headerlink" title="ABC-SMC for parameter estimation and model selection"></a>ABC-SMC for parameter estimation and model selection</h1><p>Approximate Bayesian Computation-Sequential Monte Carlo algorithm is an parallelized extension to the standard ABC algorithm. The basic idea is to do many sample simulations at one generation. Then, the best fit parameters are chosen to gain higher weight to be sampled in the next generation. With the generation proceeds, the best fit parameters converge to the “true values”. To do model selection, the models are simply treated as one parameter but at a sequential level advanced to the other parameters. That means you need to chose models first and then sample parameters to complete the sampling process.</p>
<p>The following figure shows how the samples converges to the true value for parameter estimation. It started with a uniform prior information of &amp;alpha;.<br><img src="/Rplot2.png" alt="fig"> </p>
<p>The following figure shows how model selection works under ABC-SMC algorithm. The details are coming in the future.<br><img src="/modelseleSMC.png" alt="fig"> </p>
